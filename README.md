# CubeSolver
  The program based on QT is used to solve rubik's cube with 4 cameras capturing it colors.
We plan to run the program with a machine to twist and reset the cube , and the motor frame is being made.
But this is a preliminary version which has many bugs and it is not so robust.
The idea of the work is from a youtube video in which two programmers made a wonderful and fast machine to solve rubik's cube.We just copy them.
So far,it can run on OS X only.because it can not open more than two usb cameras on windows,even if with a pcie2usb extension board.
